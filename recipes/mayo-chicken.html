        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my favorite chicken recipe, which I learned while doing low-carb dieting. I prefer dark meat so I'll use 4 legs and thighs. You can do this recipe with pork chops as well.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 whole chicken, cut into 6 pieces</li>
            <li>Â½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stir mayonnaise, garlic, rosemary, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Place chicken pieces into a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread mayonnaise mixture over chicken, and top with Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake until the juices run clear, chicken is no longer pink in the middle, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest chicken piece reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour and 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
